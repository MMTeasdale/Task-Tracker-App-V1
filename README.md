# Task-Tracker-App-V1

When doing this project I had multiple difficulties as I still have some struggles within using JavaScript, and now implementing node.js / .fs was an entirely new challenge. A challenge that I never fully figured out. I was unable to understand and implement .fs into my project. 
I know the ReadMe file is to describe the struggles and errors I endured, however, I still think there are a lot of errors I need to work through when working with Node.js, and those sorts of things. I worked with both peers, mentors, and referenced google and other resources past that. I do need to continue to work on these aspects as time progresses but I look at this as a learning experience and it did help me to research this topic further and I appreciate the task. 

I had multiple task tracker folders full of tests and trials on using .fs and JSON, as well as a littl pug as (Hector) used. None of it clicked enough or worked well enough for me to fully use it and incorporate it into my code. I used what code I did understand and commented it as I saw fit.
